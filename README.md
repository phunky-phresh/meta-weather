## What I enjoyed
- It was my first time using styled components. I have used emotio.js in the past but this time I wanted to try declaring styles in a singular location and import them where neeeded.

## What I wanted more time for
- I wanted to continue with more styling to create a smoother feel with the app. Also with my media queries.
